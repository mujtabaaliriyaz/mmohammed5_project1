            I was intrested in mathematics a lot from my childhood,
            I have always enjoyed learning mathematics. As a child I used to practice a lot of mathematics and i used to read speed mathematics books also the vedantu books, which provides us with ways by which you can improve the pace of your mathematics calculations 
             I use to always excel in mathematics in my school days. I also use to teach my fellow classmates and stared tutoring others on the same after completing my high school. In recent years I have not been teaching others as much, so one my my goals is to get back into the habit.
        </p>

            As per my professional experience I have worked on different GIS tools such as QGIS, Atlas, Google earth, Google My Maps, etc. 
            But I have not spent much time on learning Coding and soft Skills which is a thing which I regret on. 
            I have always spend much time in learning other mapping tools. whereas I would have dedicated more of my time on learning coding. 
            This is one thing which I would like to improve now and work hard on that.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            In the future, I hope to continue down the path of learing coding and getting a job in the tech industry.
